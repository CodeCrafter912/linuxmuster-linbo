# This is the default menu.lst which is automatically used by LINBO for local
# boot with reboot workaround. You don't have to provide it under /var/linbo.
#
# Grub first tries to find the reboot flag (/.linbo.reboot) which was created
# by LINBO on the root partition of the os together with the identical grub
# flag (/.grub.reboot).
# If the reboot flag was found grub sets the root partition accordingly and
# compares the two flag files. If they are different grub falls back to the
# second menu entry "LINBO PXE" and tries to pxe boot. If that fails it falls
# back to local linbo boot.
# If the two flag files were identical grub writes the string "DONE" to the
# grub flag file so that they are different on next boot. After that it tries
# to boot on three different ways before it falls back to second entry.
# For grub commands see http://diddy.boot-land.net/grub4dos/files/commands.htm.
